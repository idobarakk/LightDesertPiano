"""
Harmony utilities: detect the chord you are holding right now (fast) and the
overall key/scale you are implying over the last few seconds (slow).

Concepts in plain terms:
- A chord is the current shape under the fingers (e.g., Major, Minor, 7th).
  We detect it quickly but only accept a change if it is stable for a short
  time (to avoid flicker during transitions) and we hold it briefly once
  accepted (so visuals feel intentional).
- A scale (or key center) is the "atmosphere" suggested by recent notes.
  We estimate it over a 2â€“4s window so the background color feels coherent.

Returned types use pitch class numbers (0..11) where 0=C, 1=C#, 2=D, ... 11=B.
